For goodness sake, people should stop judging me for watching porn! What the hell is wrong with watching porn?! It's very pathetic that social norms do exist in society, that society always judges & deems what's right, wrong, acceptable & non-acceptable behaviours! Parents are the ones that have the LEAST right to lecture about‚Ä¶ More watching porn! What is the difference between watching porn & having sex for reproduction? Watching porn is just simply watching people doing intimate acts & having sex, whereas producing babies is the doing & action of having sex! If simply watching porn is such a sinful act, those involved in sexual activities & the action of having sex (including every single parent in the entire world) deserve to be condemned to death!!!

Why do guys text girls asking about the most random thing but take so long to reply when the girl has already replied. And then when we blueticked you, you keep asking about the most random shit again. And then out of nowhere you tried to ask me out? Do you think I will go out with you with these hot n cold attitude? What games are you trying to play? Can someone care to explain?

When a girl previously rejected a guy and after the guy stop chasing, begins to develop feelings for him and hoping for him to chase and initiate the second time. Are you fucking dumb? You were the one who rejected him for some reasons so of course it has to be you to initiate back this time round. Why harbour so much ego pride? If you regret, go get it back.

My confession is I have no ambition or high career goals that everyone and my family wants. I just want to work hard so that I can stop working early, get an investment plan and just retire in a peaceful countryside. I'm honestly sick of the rat race in life. I might have to migrate or go across the border to achieve it and yes‚Ä¶ More I know I need money, just not as ambitious as everyone else, but enough to get by living my style, with nature and hot tea. No rush, no deadlines, no worries, just me and nature, the way nature intended.

A series of events has completely changed me how I view on money and on society. Singapore is just too cozy for its own good and ppl outside are just literally struggling.
As what bill gates is saying, there are ppl still dying of diarrhoea. How can that be? You got 2.2m ppl dying of something that‚Äôs preventable because they born in Cambodia, Laos and not in Singapore or in US""Ôøº

""Some time ago a guy asked how to tell a lady that she has wardrobe malfunction. Being a new female this is what I learnt (yeah I am still adjusting and learning after marrying the European guy as a made to order girl). At least twice a lady purposely sat next to me and 'accidentally' step on my feet to wake me up. Now thats‚Ä¶ More how most women communicate with another woman to inform about wardrobe malfunction because telling directly will make the one suffering wardrobe malfunction feel very much embarassed.
By the way its not sexcapades. I am just letting other single guys know there are options to find someone if they cant find a lady to marry. Go find a guy to sponsor you for gender reassignmrnt and marry you. Most will sponsor you than buy a lifeless doll (thats what my husbanf told me).""

A continuation...
The father of those children were very snobbish. He looked down on tutors and gave off an air of arrogance when we were around. He would not even ask of the children‚Äôs progress and would look at us with disdain.
Until one day, he saw me at the carpark getting out of a‚Ä¶ More European brand car, waved to me and after the class he spoke to me. Utterly disgusting! Somehow he mentioned something to his children and since then, I had weird questions from the children on my family background. To which I would reply, ‚ÄúI come from an average family.‚Äù
Totally toxic and uncalled for! Which was one of the main reason why I quit.
I took up tutoring to support myself while schooling as it gave me financial freedom. ""

It‚Äôs very annoying how some people that doesn‚Äôt have depression, assumes that depression can be easily recovered from, or even those that used to have depression. Depression have many types. Just because you might have it before and recovered from it, doesn‚Äôt mean other people can do it. Others could be suffering depression‚Ä¶ More alongside anxiety, making it even difficult to recover. And what makes you fit to determine that they are not putting in efforts?

RMIT starting salary can range from 1.8k to 3k+. It all depends on how you impress the HR and managers during your interview and how you negotiate for the salary. Also depends which industry you‚Äôre joining. If you can get anything in the 2.5k-3k range, I suggest you take it. Then in 1yr look for an increment internally, or at another company. Also never stop learning, keep taking up new certifications relevant to your industry. That will give you more negotiating power for your future jobs.

I enrolled in my course along with 2 of my friends, and we have similar timetables.

I am lagging behind in class as I have a learning disability (and I'm not going to hide it! I'm proud of‚Ä¶ More how far I've come) and I'm trying to keep up but they're not very helpful especially since I haven't seen them in school since September ( I think!). I'm working full-time (thanks to the company for the flexible schedule) and I barely have time for myself, or to study.
Recently I decided not to take attendance for them and it seems like they are unhappy with me as I stopped helping them, but I stopped because they aren't helping themselves. They also actively try to guilt trip me. Am I wrong ? They said this is why I don't have a girlfriend, because I can't even help them do simple things, how to manage girlfriend ?

Job interviews be like, what are your strength and weaknesses, why did you apply for our company, what are your hobbies and blah blah blah.

OP you cant use female toilet even if you identify as female. You can do what me and many others did.

But generally law enforcement in many countries‚Ä¶ More and Singapore are understanding and they wont bother you and only advice you to get the surgery done fast.

Never understood why people call their single friend desperate either, when 1 door closes you try another door until one opens for you. Isn't that how everybody finds a gf/bf since world war 1 ? If you need to go Jurong but no cab stop, you walk there meh ? You keep trying until you get one what. If don't find now then find‚Ä¶ More when ? Science already shown babies born by parents age 35 and above have higher risk of genetic issues. If you're in a relationship and say this to your friend, shame on you, if you're single and call your friend this, well, others may want to start a family unlike you. When you're sick, your spouse would be the only person in the world that cares after your parents are gone.

Hey guys, last week a newborn came into my life. It's the best thing that happened to me. I've been married to my wife for a year, during the period of time, I have nv cheated or betrayed her. However due to my job and my social circle, I speak to quite a number of female friends/colleagues/client. Till today, she will keep‚Ä¶ More suspecting me of cheating her and throw her temper on me. I need to report to Sheher where am I what am I doing. And I'm not supposed to be out whenever I'm not working. Even texting at home piss her off, she sometimes even resort to violence. She often threaten me using our child( to bring back to maternal home), divorce me. For petty little things. After that she will feel remorseful and try to patch thing back. I understand that it may be post natal blues. But I really couldn't take it anymore I have already try to give in most of the time. It's been mentally screwing me for the longest time. I'm at all wits. #sos

Sometimes I just wish people would know that work is just work. Don't need to scold me for a few hours, give threats just because you are stress at work. The same for my autocratic manager, if I don't report everything that I do, she scolds me. If I report as per her instruction she scold me for disturbing her. Salary is‚Ä¶ More miserably low considering that I have many years of working experience. Lately I no longer smile at her and I guess she knows it. I don't talk back doesn't mean that I'm wrong. I can always quarrel back and prove my point, lose the relationship but is that what she want? If anyone ever becomes a manager in future, hope you can speak to your subordinate properly. Who has no stress? What makes you think that everyone has a good family life after work and could tolerate your constant berating?

ÔøºWhen you leave on time and all your colleagues are stunned. Got the job done and there is nothing urgent. That extra 30 minutes of fake clicking and serious staring at a blank excel spreadsheet ain't gonna get you a pay-raise. This is Singapore, not Japan. Guess what ? NOTHING HAPPENED ! Wow shocking ! If you get the job done‚Ä¶ More and leave by 5pm compared to your daydreaming colleagues who get the same task done at 8pm, your boss should give you a promotion instead for high efficiency and cost-savings on OT payout.

ÔøºÔøº I have a huge crush on this girl but I're merely a stranger to her, probably, at most lecture mates who has never spoken to each other, because I'm shy and she seems uninterested in socialising in school. The only thing I can do is to stalk her on FB cos she is quite active here. But the most awkward thing for me happened‚Ä¶ More today, was walking towards the bus stop and she was seated on the benches at the foyer. Initially, she was staring into space, but she suddenly started to wave at me, with a bright smile on her face. I don't know what gmfu, but I stupidly raised up my hand and waved back, until I heard a voice from behind me, calling for her - it was her boyfriend. I mean I know she has a boyfriend all along but it just sucks when you realise that wave was not meant for you but her boyfriend. If only I got to know her earlier.... she is really cute though... but it will be sinful if I started to pursue her knowing that she is in a blissful relationship with her boyfriend.

Hi guys, Any tips and tricks to lower down my ego? I have this persistent ego problem to strive for excellence and I am not fond of rules at all.

I do what I think is right and what is the best without giving a shit about what other people think about me as long as I can justify myself and argue my way out logically.

Months ago, I caught my boyfriend messaging a girl that he would like to visit her place. He claims it's nothing, that it is mere banter between acquistance in the same work industry. Months later, as we were talking about settling down and to look at wedding bands, he exclaimed that he doesnt want to wear one. I brushed it‚Ä¶ More aside, thinking it was nothing.
Until recently, we went overseas together and never once had he uploaded any photos of us together even though we have been together for close to 2 years. He shared that it is nothing personal - he just doesnt like anyone to know about us. He doesnt have a habit of uploading any photos of any girlfriends - even when he was with his ex girlfriend. Then last night, I saw the same girl who I caught him texting with, commenting on a photo of his ""yandao"" (roughly translated as jandsome)... Am I being paranoid? Or am I right for believing that he doesnt want anyone to know he has a girlfriend because he still wants to flirt around?

Replying to #SIMConfession17321. I am a girl but I also feel the same. I have no boyfriend because I have no money. The mentality of today's guys is no longer the same as the previous generation.

When I was young, my mom personally heard her friend talking to her son ""If you want this flat, marry this girl."" When I become adult, she and her son continuously finding ways to approach me.

Can I know if UOL graduate certs include the attendance records ? I attend school everyday and got 100% in previous years but the attendance app screwed up everything despite me being in class. They asked me to appeal but SIMConnect doesn't even work how do we even appeal and if it keeps happening it would be ridiculous to‚Ä¶ More appeal for something I did not commit. If their lousy system ruins my resume I would be pretty pissed, I wake up at 6am to attend school on time and I got reminder for low attendance, what a absolute joke of a infrastructure, both app and website.

I kinda feel sad over the private uni discrimination in SG. I know so many of us here who are just probably only a few grades short or less than 0.5 gpa short of entering local uni.

Its not like we can't qualify for better education overseas. But sadly with no rich family back up... SIM is the best choice.

Tbh, not everyone who wants to migrate, hates the country. It could be that it's hot, some people favor four seasons or cooler climates, can't change that. The landscape is 'average', some people like mountain hiking or fishing on rivers during weekends, can't change that. Housing and certain amenities, bigger houses, permanent‚Ä¶ More cars, more things to do, can't change that either. So the only thing we can change, is ourselves and our location. Moving abroad is not only for the rich, there are overseas Asians for example, opening restaurants, massage parlor, being waiters, grocery clerk, if it was truly out-of-reach (tax,etc..), these people would have starved, but are doing fine. I don't get why people like to give those that want to migrate such a harsh judgement, Sg is nice but there are many nice places as well.

To #SIMConfession17036 to be honest inititally I do not like the ideal of shaving or removing the pubes hair untill one day i decided to take the 1st step. I shaved my pubes and I'm quite surprised as lots of comments about shaving will give you itchyness but not for me. I guess it varies to individual. After shaving, my vagina‚Ä¶ More felt so refresh and cooling, and somehow my sex drive increased getting horny easily and more frequent to the extend i have to DIY in the handicap toilet. My suggestion is just shave your pubes, going to IPL etc means you have to expose your vagina to strangers which i feel somewhat uncomfortable with.

Reading the news and online comments, it's funny how Caucasians complain there are too many Middle Easterners or Asians in their country, yet they themselves seem to be everywhere. I have yet to see a country that has no white presence in it and I would consider myself to be rather well traveled. Even in lesser known provinces of China, Thailand, Bali, India etc. one could easily spot at least 2 Caucasians a day, walking about. Globalization works both ways doesn't it ?

I genuinely dont know how to sit through a lecture and keep hearing these people talk nonstop instead of listening to the lecturer. If you dont want to listen, then just dont disturb the people around you lah. So difficult meh. Or as lecturers always say, if you want to talk, then leave the class. Simple as that.

Heya. I returned to Bukit Batok Driving Centre after a hiatus. Originally signed up for Class 3C Manual in 2012 after turning 18(was not aware that it was manual instead of auto). But I only started driving practical this October due to procrastination and partly study. Just had my third practical in which at times, I could‚Ä¶ More move off smoothly and at times, I threw off the clutch, jerked the car and stalled the engine. Some people would tell me that it is good taking manual license as it is more advantageous; can drive both automatic and manual vehicles. Others would tell me to switch to auto as I would struggle with coordination for manual transmission and furthermore, most cars are automatic apart from heavy vehicles like vans, lorries, trucks etc. Even the instructor told me that manual license is 3 times harder than auto. Should I persevere with manual and struggle along the way, possibly taking a longer time to complete, or switch to auto?

Hi 16421. I can assure you there are many opportunities when you graduate.
Logistics jobs are on the demand. It depends what role you take on, eg procurement, warehouse, operations, supply chain etc. Graduates will usually take on management roles in this field after understudying your mentor.

""Logistics jobs are highly in demand now. I can safely say that many graduates are flocking to banks, accounting and marketing, making those field extremely competitive. Big firms will usually hire ivy league grads first, followed by local uni then us. But if you can make yourself unique, i dont see why u cant compete with them.

There is a lot of psychologically damaged women around. I‚Äôm not sexist or against women but this is my observation. This is increasingly common in Singapore. Domestic violence and childhood trauma contributed significantly to it. These women will end up displaying toxic, manipulative and gaslighting behaviour wherever they go‚Ä¶ More to. They let other people take ownership for their own mistakes. They also attack others, sow discord among people, take a lot of energy and resources from others, etc. In fact, these women do not know that they are wrong. It helps when self aware women seek psychological help and counselling, or if people are aware of psychologically damaged women, please encourage them to see a counsellor or psychiatrist.

Isn't it weird how in Singapore you use umbrella to shelter sunlight people judge you. Wear sunscreen people think you overreacting. Wear a hat, sunglasses or long sleeves people think you're a fashionista ? Funny thing is, we live near the Equator and have 365 days of summer, doesn't that make us one of the most qualified country to use all the above ? Yet we also rely on foreign products for said problems, I'm surprise we haven't become a market leader in this field.

Be realistic, take your Uni cert, go out and find a job that don‚Äôt pay $3k and gain that experience. Once you have that experience, you can even talk about 20% or 30% jump in salary.

You are wrong to say no one cares about the the type of degree (distance learning for SIM or local degrees like SUTD).
As a fresh grad, you will be scrutinized. Many positions will be exceptionally tough, or most likely be impossible to secure if you are graduating with a distance learning degree.
Yes,‚Ä¶ More you are correct to say that once you prove yourself, things definitely change.
The gist is this - You WILL be discriminated and start off at least 30%-40% less compared to local grads. You MAY start off the same as a poly grad.
If you prove yourself, however, you MAY close the gap with a local grad and MAY catch up with totally shitty local grads. So the age old question is always this - Is going to a distance learning institution better than just working after you grad from poly?
Same goes for JC students who did terribly. Poly can be much cheaper than a distance learning institution course. Have ROI in mind. (04/07/2019 11:50)",,2019-07-05 11:13:00,,5,2,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2610851575643845&id=500110393384651,

""Changing employers perception of SIM graduates begins with us.
How we carry ourselves, our work ethics & attitudes.
It doesn‚Äôt matter even if our branding isn‚Äôt optimal right now.
As Long as we constantly seek growth, approach everything with sincerity, we will eventually change mindsets and gain recognition.
Through my‚Ä¶ More internship, I have met fellow local U students from BCG, McKinsey, Amazon & Microsoft.
Honestly as a SIM student, I was intimidated at first. But at the end of the day, I realised all these local U students are just like us.
We are all but a blank sheet of paper when we begin.
What we fill it up with, ultimately depends on our own individual hunger for growth.
Let‚Äôs not limit ourselves by bothering what others think of us, and start making change and growth from within ourselves.
But it takes all of us. Let‚Äôs all work harder from now on shall we?

So many students want to experience '‚Ä¶ Moreindependence' in Uni but aren't even willing to do anything about it.

When we were 18, everyone's right of passage was to drink alcohol and go to clubs, one cannot happen without the other. Clubs open at 10.30pm++, and get fun at 1am. So everyone was ""conditioned"" to drink only at 10pm onwards as there was no reason to meet earlier as the clubs‚Ä¶ More would be empty or closed. NOW, here's the problem, most of us never grew out of the 10pm rule, so any drinking or chilling before 10pm will seem odd or weird now even if we are not clubbing. Technically, we could save time and money by starting earlier, but we simply don't. We have no idea why either and it fks up our sleep, body and wallet, but we still do it, because fk common sense.

When your phone accidentally dials an old acquaintance or distant relative, you don't know how and why it's still in your contacts but it is such a cringeworthy awkward mess. It's like ""hey, yeah my phone dialled wrongly, ya I guess we still have each others number for some reason, yeah we are no longer close, lets end this conversation now, I'm gonna hang up now"". This is as scary as receiving phonecalls from an unknown number, it could either be the delivery guy or another scammer, you wouldn't know.

Tbh I think it's about time local businesses amplifed the ""Made in Singapore"" branding. We already have a good image and people trust the brand. So far we only have axe oil, tiger balm and Tiger beer. About time we venture into technology like earphones, bicycles, scuba diving gear etc... Yes it's going to be expensive but aren'‚Ä¶ Moret people already buying overpriced Made in Japan or USA products anyway ? These don't require huge manufacturing spaces and are highly feasible. Our export game is still pretty weak. And quality is assured because locals will roast you upside down if your shit sucks because we like to complain, so honest and good feedback in product development

Life advice: I still see alot of uncle & aunties carrying big grocery bags home. If that sounds like your parents, teach or help them to order groceries online. Some of you are pampered, so you don't cook and clueless about household grocery expenses, but your mother spends well over $90 on weekly family groceries which already‚Ä¶ More guarantees free delivery and it's ALOT of stuff to carry. If online products are spoilt or missing, refunds are instant and no questions asked. So if it's fresh, well-packed and free delivery, why not just help your parents out by clicking a few buttons ? People shop online for clothes but can't even buy survival necessities, I am still baffled.

Well basically my friend of #simconfession13997 my justifications are perfect. If there is any discussion of equality it should be made perfectly equal not one sided. Well I have a girlfriend and we have been together for 5 years. She says I am the best. I give her equal rights. Our basis of decisions are based on logic, weiging‚Ä¶ More pros and cons, and value for money. We also discussed that in future when we get married we will let the one earning less to be the homemaker. We also discussed how we should then create opportunities for the homemaker through alternative forms of self employment (i.e. the one working will finance the homemaker to trade shares and build a portfolio of penny stocks). My girlfriend is not as shallow as the girl who lambasted me blindly with blind assumptions. We dont smoke, we dont drink, we dont use vulgar language. We live a refined life.

""There has been many sides and debate on Male Vs Female and often the debates are emotional.
As a woman I have the following gathered from all the debates:
Men
1. They claim that women ask for equality but not genuine equality in that they leave unwanted tasks to men
2. Men are not allowed to do things which women do but women‚Ä¶ More are allowed to do things men do
Women
1. Men are not giving women equal rights
2. Men are being biased against women
I think for a compromise we must be fair to both sides. Somehow if I look at the trend the increasing crime against women had correlated with increase in female rights.

To #SIMConfesion13817, I don't know where you're shopping but most reputable bikes sell for at least $800 unless it's a kids model. I would be wary because if you are going to pay so much as a hobby or commuting, just buy a good brand. Considering you're also not a cycling enthusiast, a one time payment of a $900 bicycle would‚Ä¶ More suffice and definitely last you 10+ years with enjoyment and most non-bikers don't even service their bikes so quality is at least reassured somehow. The only thing you would have to do is pump air into the tires and that's available for free at gas stations to DIY. Another thing is if you live HDB, find a way to park in your house even if it means lifting up stairs, alot of douchebags likes to steal branded bicycle or disassemble parts if parked in public.

No doubt our education system seems to revolve around, ‚Äòmemorisation‚Äô, however with understanding, our brain accepts those facts, theories and concepts that we we want to memorise/remember and hence it is faster we get it in our brain with a less painful/ dreadful process and it can be retained longer in our mind.

Now I am dating another lady who is a mutual friend, she's really nice and I feel she's long-term material. However, I am still having sex with my schoolmate (now attached as well) and my ex-colleague occasionally. I don't meet them that often, probably once a week or two.

I understand your view that we should be appreciative of what we have. I shall stay neutral in my views of his teaching methods. However, one thing I do have to highlight and certainly have to put it out there, his notes are sub-par and this is a severe underestimation.
‚Ä¶ More Recently, i went back to take a peek at his notes on one of the topics i was researching on, his note on that particular topic barely scraped the surface. It is less than 10% out of the entirety of the subject of interest. It is confusing and misleading and certainly not enough for us to write 3 pages of relevant content with. The lecturer that I crashed had much more depth in terms of his materials, teaching style and it facilitates critical thinking and points me(for the very least) in the right direction to carry out further research on the subject at hand. Nonetheless, those are exclusively my opinions. However, you are free to have your opinions as well. Cheers.

In a dilemma here and was hoping I could get some help here. I‚Äôm a final year student studying pych and comm in UB. Spr 2019 is my final sem. However, my CGPA isn‚Äôt enough to qualify for latin honors. I have 2 options: 1) Continue with my final sem and graduate with a regular degree 2) Repeat a mod and take 2‚Ä¶ More extra mods to graduate with cum laude.
The latter is an option would obviously delay my graduation (tbh, not a big problem for me) and is $$$( now this is quite a problem) Also, I will have to get straight As in the mods that I take. The former option might have a major impact in my career and further studies after I graduate.
I am considering the 2nd option, but I want to know what are the pros and cons of graduating with latin honors Vs. without. Is it really worth to spend money and time to get a cum laude degree now?

Hence I created this form https://letshang.typeform.com/to/p4AuXK?linkfrom=j5tl for like-minded people to get matched and meet for this Christmas! It's kinda like Valentine's Matching on NUSWhispers, but I did a similar one for Christmas, and there are more preferences that one can choose. It is also female-centric (for example the matching algorithm prioritizes the females' preferences first.) so hopefully, that could encourage more girls to sign up as I read somewhere usually guys outnumber girls by a huge amount.
I hope this gives other students like me a chance to meet someone new, and hopefully, that could blossom into something :) (12/11/2018 14:52)

Look bro, that's your opinion. Its not the 'hard truth'. I respect that you're inclined towards the open, polyamorous kind of relationship. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as the people who participate in it know what they're in for and give their consent. But its not necessarily better than a monogamous relationship.

Singaporeans are the most adaptable due to being multicultural and deep down we all can switch on or off ""accents"" no matter the language. Yet a few people feel the need to belittle those who has this ability, which 90% of the world is using, judging the way English was meant to be enunciated by the original inventors.

Modern guys are shy and dumb AF so waiting mostly ain't gonna work and you‚Ä¶ More must be FREAKING obvious.
If you know a guy likes you, did you know standing near him in groups, 'accidental' physical contact, smiling at him makes him smitten on the inside but as a guy he will act cool.

This year's theme is on empowering women which I feel is a great theme. However, the first runner up restricts her diet - tofu, bananas and sweet potatoes, and works out around the clock. Sure, no one voiced out‚Ä¶ More because let's face it, she is a pretty face with a hot body, a social influencer and the face of many organizations.
But what happens if we removed the pretty face and the big boobs from the equation. If we look at the bigger picture, is she trying to be a role model to women of all ages to be 'anorexic'? Are we teaching the younger generation to only love their body by looking like her - long legs, flat stomach, big boobs, pretty face etc and eat like her? Or are we teaching girls and women alike to accept them for who they are despite their flaw, despite that number on the scale, despite that extra love handle, as long as they are physically and mentally healthy?

Last UOL paper is in a few weeks time BUT I haven‚Äôt secured any jobs yet. I have been sending out my resume to 150 companies and only 2 got back to me. One is an admin job in a bank and another is a RM - which will be my last resort. I do not think my resume is empty? Second class with 2 internships? SIM cert is looked down‚Ä¶ More but a lot of companies. This few weeks have been quite depressing. With exams killing me, unemployment will be the next. So I went on LinkedIn to see how the SIM graduates fair and noticed a trend. A lot of them did not land themselves a good career. Either insurances agent, back office or RM.
Then I clicked on this Marcus Yip's profile. He graduated last year and landed into investment banking in a local bank?? like HOW?? I seriously think he is the only SIM grad landed an FT IB role.

As a final year student who had gone through (almost) 3 years of UOL and will be doing my 3rd exam, here are my two-cents worth regarding the programme.
Is UOL hard? Well, that depends on you yourself. Why is this so? Throughout my years in SIM, I've encountered a variety of lecturers (some are really good at delivering‚Ä¶ More the content while others are like robots just reciting whatever the subject guide says). BUT never have I felt that because of a lack of decent lecturer would I be hindered in getting my A.

In recent times, there are so many posts on social media where the vigilantes try to take justice into their own hands. But many have forgotten that the gravity of their words can really affect certain people gravely. Here's a little something for everyone so that we can be more mindful of our words or things that we post‚Ä¶ More online.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Words are like water,
For once spoken, it can never be taken back.
Words cut deeper than any sword would,
For what it hurts are not mortal wounds.
Words can incite or quell,
For its powers are far beyond imaginable.
Words can be tiring to read,
For it‚Äôs tiring to the writer‚Äôs hand as well.
With this, the pen is laid to rest and never be picked up again.
For typing would be far more logical in this day and age.

Sales job are in fact one of the highest paying job if you are willing to put in effort and excel in it. And sales people are one of the toughest job as they face countless of rejections everyday. But if you are willing to put in effort and‚Ä¶ More work with the right attitude, you will definitely be successful one day.
Quoted from Brian Tracy : """" Fully five percent of self-made millionaires are men and women who are the top salespeople in their fields. They never started their own businesses. They never went to college or university to get professional degrees. They just became very good salespeople for their products or services and were paid very good money""""
So therefore I believe that if you have the drive and will to succeed, you definitely can be successful in this industry.

1. You can try to look for job in JobDB, JobStreet or even Indeed.
2. Let ask yourselves a few questions:
- If a 5.5 day position was offered to you, will you accept it?
- Do you mind to work in ulu areas?
If the answers are YES and NO respectively, I think you can get a job easily. The‚Ä¶ More reason is because Singapore government has set regulations on the ratio Singaporean/PR to Foreigners. Of course, you should indicate that you are a Singaporean/PR. When a HR filters resumes, they will always look at the nationality as they will affect the company's manpower quota.
3. If a HR is interested to hire you, they will contact you within a week. Of course, there are exceptional cases. For instances, their ideal candidate rejected their offer. That is why they offered you. If you did not receive any news within a week, you might want to give a call to people. Sending an email for an update indicates that you are interested in getting this job.
Hope my 2 cents help! :]
